== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why should I use internal links for my Wordpress Site? =

** Search Engine Optimization (SEO): ** By linking relevant pages and posts within your site, you provide search engines with a clear understanding of the structure of your site and how the pages are related to each other. This can help to improve your site's visibility in search results and make it easier for users to find what they're looking for.

** Improving Site Navigation: ** Internal links can help users navigate your site and find related content, which can improve the overall user experience and keep them on your site for longer.

** Reducing Bounce Rate: ** By providing users with links to related content, you can reduce the number of visitors who leave your site after only viewing one page. This can help to lower your site's bounce rate and improve its overall engagement metrics.

** Readability and User Experience: ** Internal links can make it easier for users to find related content and understand the structure of your site. This can lead to a better reading experience and help to keep users engaged with your site for longer.

** Distributing Page Authority: ** By linking to other pages within your site, you can help to distribute the authority and ranking power of your site more evenly. This can help to improve the visibility of individual pages and make it easier for users to find the content they're looking for.

== What happens if I take a post/page down? Won't I have broken Internal Links? ==

AI Internal Links has your back. Whenever you run the plugin, the plugin checks that all Internal Links are up to date. Broken links are always removed.

== Can I have too many Internal Links? ==

Sure, too many internal links can affect the performance of a site if not managed properly. 

Excessive internal linking can increase the size of the HTML pages, slow down the page load times, and cause confusion for users. 

Additionally, if internal links are not optimized, they can lead to a high number of 404 errors, which can negatively impact the user experience and the site's search engine ranking. 

It's important to strike a balance between providing helpful internal links for navigation and optimizing performance by limiting the number of links on a page.

That's why we recommend up to 3 Internal Links per page or post, and we don't allow more than 10.

== What if I want to uninstall the plugin, will the links stay on my site? ==

Sure, unless you decide to automatically remove them, the links stay, no strings attached.
